# Frontend Mentor - Blog preview card solution

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Google Fonts (Figtree)

## What I learned

While building this project, I practiced:

- Using `:root` variables for consistent styling
- Applying `box-shadow` and `border-radius` for card UI
- Styling hover effects with `transition`
- Using flexbox to align elements properly

Example CSS Iâ€™m proud of:

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  max-width: 24rem;
  background-color: var(--white);
  padding: 1.5rem;
  border-radius: var(--card-radius);
  gap: 0.75rem;
  border: 0.0625rem solid;
  box-shadow: 0.5rem 0.5rem 0 black;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to improve my skills in CSS animations and transitions to make components more interactive.  
Also, I plan to learn more about accessibility to make my projects user-friendly for all users.
